href=\"#\">What is a Trust?<\/a><\/dt>\n      <dd><p>A Trust is a fiduciary relationship in which one party, known as a settlor, gives another party, the trustee, the right to hold title to property or assets for the benefit of a third party, the beneficiary. The trustee can professionally manage the settlor\u2019s property in accordance with his or her instructions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Trust is widely recognized around the world. Overseas courts and prestigious financial institutions also recognize such structure. In Hong Kong, a trustee is not only bounded by Hong Kong Trust Law (Trustee Ordinance Cap.29 and Recognition of Trusts Ordinance Cap. 76) but also the Hague Convention of International Law.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Law of Trust developed in the United Kingdom hundreds of years ago. In the past, it was constructed as part of the equity which helped to reduce the strictness of the Common Law. Nowadays, all these past judgements have become the main source of law in Hong Kong and other Commonwealth countries.<\/p><\/dd>\n        <dt> <a href=\"#\">Is the Trust robust?<\/a><\/dt>\n      <dd><p style=\"font-weight: bold\";> 1) High compliance regulation<\/p>\n\n<p>Trust service in Hong Kong has a history of more than 100 years and are regulated by the Hong Kong Trustee Ordinance, which mirrors British Trust Law. Hong Kong trusts are also protected by the Hong Kong Recognition of Trusts Ordinance of which The Hague Convention also applies to it. Trust licensed companies in Hong Kong are directly monitored by the Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.<\/p>\n\n\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold\";> 2) Independence of the trust asset<\/p>\n\n<p>Section 89 of Chapter 29 of the Trustee Ordinance stipulates that all money, property and securities received or held by any trust company as a trustee shall always be kept separately from the money, property and securities of the company. Each trust is marked in the account book to distinguish it from any other money, property and securities in the company\u2019s register and other account books. Therefore, no trust money shall form part of the company\u2019s assets or be mixed with the company\u2019s assets at any time . The client's assets will never be used to repay the debts of the trust company according to the Article 11 of Cap. 76 Recognition of Trusts Ordinance. Therefore, the trust assets are protected in law and not affected by the collapse of the Trust Company. <\/p><\/dd>\n        <dt> <a href=\"#\">What is the difference between a Trust account and bank account?<\/a><\/dt>\n      <dd><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #C5A96C;\">\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 40%;\">\n<p style=\"color:#fff; text-align:center;\"><strong>Trust Account<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 40%;\">\n<p style=\"color:#fff; text-align:center;\"><strong>Bank Account<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #C5A96C;\">\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">\n<p style=\"color:#fff; \"><strong>Legal Title<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 40%;\">\n<p style=\"color:#fff; text-align:center;\"><strong>Trustee (Trust company)<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 40%;\">\n<p style=\"color:#fff; text-align:center;\"><strong>Client<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">\n<p><strong>Confidentiality <\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 40%;\">\n<p><strong>High. <\/strong>Trust is a non-disclosure agreement<strong>. <\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 40%;\">\n<p><strong>Low. <\/strong>It can be accessed by the Judiciary.<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">\n<p><strong>Autonomy<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 40%;\">\n<p><strong>High. <\/strong>The Trust Company will only execute the instructions of the settlor.<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 40%;\">\n<p><strong>Low<\/strong>.

A family trust is any trust vehicle that you've set up to benefit members of your family. The family trust is a popular vehicle in estate planning. You know your family best, and a family trust can help you customize how you provide for your family, both during your lifetime and after your death. <\/p>\n\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold\";>The initial trust property of a family trust can be:<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Current assets (e.g. cash, securities, fund units)<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Fixed assets (e.g. land and real estate, art, antiques and collectibles)<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Contracts and agreements (e.g. including insurance contracts, private contracts, commercial agreements)<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold\";>Benefits of a Family Trust:<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Avoid expensive court certification procedures for probate of the Will while the estate might be being frozen during the probate period.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 High confidentiality. Estate information does not become a public record like a Will.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Promote family harmony since family trust is very difficult to refute or challenge.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Prevent squandering money for pleasure in the next generations. Family trust can distribute the property exactly as you want to avoid future generations being profligate.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Scalable. the establishment can increase assets at any time as needed, and the establishment of a \"durable power of attorney\" to designate someone to deal with in times when they cannot manage the transaction.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022 When the establishment loses the legal physical and will judgment ability, it is not necessary to appoint an asset manager through a certified court.<\/p><\/dd>\n        <dt> <a href=\"#\">Will I lose control of the assets in a Trust?<\/a><\/dt>\n      <dd><p>No. All the investment powers and asset management functions will be reserved by you. You are also obliged to assign a new trustee or revoke the trust deed anytime provided that you are the settlor of a revocable trust.<\/p><\/dd>\n        <dt> <a href=\"#\">Is Trust regulations different from bank regulation?<\/a><\/dt>\n      <dd><p>Yes. Trust regulation has predominantly evolved upon Common Law and equitable principles where fiduciary duty is the overarching requirement. In contrast, banking regulation is typically based on well formulated rules and regulations which govern almost all actions and reporting requirements which banking institutions need to follow to the letter.<\/p>\n\n<p>Arguably, trust regulation provides the trustee with greater flexibility in terms of actions which it can execute on management of trust assets and in its reporting requirements. Trust regulation will often allow settlor and beneficiaries to maintain a significantly higher level of discretion.<\/p>\n\n<p>From application of Common Law and equitable principles, the legal title of assets vested under trust (subject to certain timeline constraints) will no longer be in the name of the original contributor but be transferred to the trustee. Hence, personal creditors of the settlor or claimants under matrimonial, family feudal or other civil litigation will not be able to claim the assets under trust. Unlike under banking regulation, customers\u2019 assets are under personal or corporate legal title which means there will be less legal protection from any legal challenge or claimant against the assets of the person or corporate.<\/p><\/dd>\n        <dt> <a href=\"#\">Who can be beneficiaries of my Trust?<\/a><\/dt>\n      <dd><p>Anyone. You, as a settlor of the trust, can also be the beneficiary of your own trust. According to Section 2(c) Recognition of Trusts Ordinance (Cap. 76), if you have not decided who will be the beneficiary\/beneficiaries of your trust, you can always assign a class of persons as your beneficiaries. For instance, your children or grandchildren.<\/p><\/dd>\n        <dt> <a href=\"#\">How long can a Trust last for? Can I terminate my Trust?<\/a><\/dt>\n      <dd><p>A trust set up in Hong Kong can last forever if you do not terminate it, which means your assets would be protected by a trust for an unlimited period. However, you can always terminate it if you are subject to a revocable trust (s3A Perpetuities and Accumulations Ordinance Cap. 257).<\/p><\/dd>\n        <dt> <a href=\"#\">If my trustee (a trust corporation) goes bankrupt, will my assets in the Trust be affected?<\/a><\/dt>\n      <dd><p>Section 89 of Chapter 29 of the Trustee Ordinance stipulates that all money, property and securities received or held by any trust company as a trustee shall always be kept separately from the money, property and securities of the company. Each trust is marked in the account book to distinguish it from any other money, property and securities in the company\u2019s register and other account books. Therefore, no trust money shall form part of the company\u2019s assets or be mixed with the company\u2019s assets at any time . The client's assets will never be used to repay the debts of the trust company according to the Article 11 of Cap. 76 Recognition of Trusts Ordinance. Therefore, the trust assets are protected in law and not affected by the collapse of the Trust Company. <\/p><\/dd>\n        <dt> <a href=\"#\">Can I vest my overseas assets to my trustee?<\/a><\/dt>\n      <dd><p>Under section 41Y of the Trustee Ordinance (Cap. 29), the validity of transfer of movable assets would not be affected by the foreign law of succession.

In most cases, assets held in China cannot be transferred to an offshore family trust directly.

Our legal department will assess whether or not that is feasible and provide alternatives which fit your situation.<\/p><\/dd>\n        <dt> <a href=\"#\">If I am involved in a Matrimonial Proceeding, will my assets held by the trustee be affected?<\/a><\/dt>\n      <dd><p>The custodial trust service provided by FGA Trust can act as a firewall of property.

Furthermore, the legal title of trust assets is the trustee, who is responsible for managing the trust assets in accordance with the terms and special duties imposed on him.

Rule 21 Non-contentious Probate Rules (Cap 10A) provides that where a person dies wholly intestate, the persons having a beneficial interest in the estate shall be entitled to a grant to administration. For instance, the surviving spouse, children or parents of the deceased. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you have set up a trust which is managed by a licensed trust company, the trustee will distribute the trust assets in accordance to his or her wishes when the settlor dies.
